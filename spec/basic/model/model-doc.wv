## Markdown-based model documentation

- Use tiple-hyphen so that triple-backquote of Markdown can be used in the documentation. For example:

This model is equivalent to the following SQL query:
```sql
select * from 'person.json'
```

You can add more filters like:
```wv
-- comment
from my_model
where id = 1
```
---
model my_model =
  -- scan a json file
  from 'person.json' -- Load data from 'person.json'
  -- ETL
  where id is not null -- cleanup
end
