# Task-Oriented Syntax Design for Wvlet Flow

## Overview

Design syntax extensions for wvlet's flow language to support task management features found in modern workflow orchestration tools (Temporal, Airflow, Dagster, Prefect).

## Research Summary

### Key Concepts from Workflow Tools

| Concept | Temporal | Airflow | Dagster | Wvlet Flow (Current) |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Orchestration unit | Workflow | DAG | Job | `flow` |
| Work unit | Activity | Task/Operator | Op/Asset | `stage` |
| Composition | Child Workflows | SubDAGs | Nested Jobs | `-> FlowName` (jump) |
| Branching | Signals/Conditions | BranchOperator | Dynamic outputs | `route { case ... }` |
| Parallel | Promises/Futures | Parallel tasks | Parallel ops | `fork { ... }` |
| Fan-in | Promise.all() | TriggerRule | Graph edges | `merge` |

### Temporal's Key Design Patterns

1. **Workflows are deterministic** - orchestration logic only, no side effects
2. **Activities do the real work** - can be non-deterministic, have retries
3. **Four timeout types**: start-to-close, schedule-to-close, heartbeat, schedule-to-start
4. **Retry policies**: initial interval, backoff coefficient, max interval, max attempts
5. **Parent close policies**: terminate, request_cancel, abandon
6. **Signals/Queries**: external interaction with running workflows
7. **Continue-As-New**: reset history for long-running workflows

## Execution Model

### Stage States

Each stage has a well-defined execution state:

```
pending → running → success
                  ↘ failed → retrying → success
                           ↘ failed (exhausted)
                  ↘ skipped
                  ↘ cancelled
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pending` | Waiting for dependencies |
| `running` | Currently executing |
| `success` | Completed successfully |
| `failed` | Execution failed (may retry) |
| `retrying` | Retrying after failure |
| `skipped` | Skipped due to upstream failure or trigger rule |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled by user or parent flow |

### Dependency Rules

Stages form a DAG based on:
1. **Data dependencies**: `from stage_name` creates an edge
2. **Control dependencies**: `depends on stage_name` creates an edge without data flow
3. **Failure dependencies**: `on_failure: stage_name` creates a conditional edge (runs only if source fails)

### Trigger Rules

Determine when a stage executes based on upstream states:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `all_success` | Run only if ALL upstream stages succeeded (default) |
| `one_success` | Run if AT LEAST ONE upstream succeeded |
| `none_failed` | Run if NO upstream failed (success or skipped) |
| `all_done` | Run after all upstreams complete (any state) |
| `always` | Always run regardless of upstream state |

## Type System Extensions

### Duration Literals

Introduce typed duration literals (not strings):

```wv
-- Duration literal syntax: number followed by unit
5m      -- 5 minutes
30s     -- 30 seconds
2h      -- 2 hours
1d      -- 1 day
100ms   -- 100 milliseconds
```

Duration units: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`

### Backoff Strategy Enum

```wv
-- Backoff strategies are keywords, not strings
backoff: constant     -- Fixed delay
backoff: linear       -- Linearly increasing delay
backoff: exponential  -- Exponentially increasing delay (default)
```

---

## Grammar Rules

### Config Block Syntax

Use only `with { }` block syntax (no `[ ]` shorthand to avoid parsing ambiguity):

```
stage_def := "stage" IDENT [config_block] "=" stage_body

config_block := "with" "{" config_items "}"

config_items := (config_item NEWLINE)*

config_item := IDENT ":" config_value

config_value := INTEGER           -- retries: 3
              | DURATION          -- timeout: 5m
              | BACKOFF_STRATEGY  -- backoff: exponential
              | TRIGGER_RULE      -- trigger: all_success
              | IDENT             -- on_failure: fallback_stage
```

### Precedence

1. `with { }` binds to the immediately preceding `stage` name
2. `=` separates config from stage body
3. `|` chains operations within stage body
4. `->` is a flow operator (jump), not used in config

---

## Syntax Design

### Core Syntax: Stage Configuration (v1 Scope)

Extend stages with task configuration using `with { }` block:

```wv
flow DataPipeline = {
  stage extract with {
    retries: 3
    timeout: 5m
    retry_delay: 1s
    backoff: exponential
  } = from api_source | fetch_data()

  stage transform = from extract | normalize()

  stage load with {
    retries: 5
    timeout: 10m
    heartbeat: 30s
  } = from transform | save to warehouse
}
```

**Stage-level properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `retries` | Int | 0 | Max retry attempts |
| `timeout` | Duration | none | Start-to-close timeout |
| `retry_delay` | Duration | 1s | Initial retry delay |
| `backoff` | Enum | exponential | Backoff strategy |
| `max_retry_delay` | Duration | none | Cap on backoff delay |
| `heartbeat` | Duration | none | Heartbeat interval for long-running stages |

---

### Error Handling with Trigger Rules

Explicit error handling with clear dependency semantics:

```wv
flow ResilientPipeline = {
  stage primary with {
    retries: 3
  } = from source | call_primary_api()

  -- Runs only if primary fails (after all retries exhausted)
  stage fallback with {
    on_failure: primary   -- creates conditional dependency edge
  } = from source | call_backup_api()

  -- Runs if either primary or fallback succeeds
  stage continue with {
    trigger: one_success
  } = from primary, fallback | process()
}
```

**Semantics:**
- `on_failure: stage_name` creates an edge that activates only when the named stage fails
- The fallback stage receives the same input as the failed stage (via `from source`)
- `trigger: one_success` allows downstream to proceed if any upstream succeeded

---

### Flow-Level Configuration

Flow-level properties apply to the entire flow:

```wv
flow DailyETL with {
  schedule: cron('0 2 * * *')  -- 2 AM daily
  timezone: 'UTC'
  concurrency: 1               -- max concurrent executions
} = {
  stage extract = from source | fetch_daily_data()
  stage transform = from extract | clean_and_normalize()
  stage load = from transform | save to warehouse
}
```

**Flow-level properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `schedule` | Schedule | Cron or interval schedule |
| `timezone` | String | Timezone for schedule |
| `concurrency` | Int | Max concurrent flow executions |
| `timeout` | Duration | Total flow timeout |

---

### Child Flow Invocation

Use `call` keyword for explicit child flow invocation:

```wv
flow ParentFlow = {
  stage setup = from config | initialize()

  -- Invoke child flow with explicit call syntax
  stage child with {
    timeout: 1h
    parent_close: abandon  -- terminate | request_cancel | abandon
  } = call ChildFlow(param: setup.value)

  stage cleanup = from child | finalize()
}

flow ChildFlow(param: string) = {
  stage work = from param | long_running_task()
}
```

**Parent close policies:**
- `terminate` - forcefully stop child when parent closes (default)
- `request_cancel` - send cancellation request to child
- `abandon` - let child continue independently

---

### Idempotency Keys

Ensure idempotent execution with explicit key specification:

```wv
flow PaymentProcessing = {
  stage charge with {
    retries: 3
    idempotency_key: transaction_id  -- field name from input schema
  } = from payment_request | process_payment()
}
```

The `idempotency_key` references a field from the stage's input relation schema.

---

## Future Extensions (Out of Scope for v1)

These features are documented for future consideration but not included in the initial implementation:

### Signals and Queries (Temporal Pattern)

```wv
-- Future: External interaction with running flows
flow LongRunning with {
  signal pause: () -> set_paused(true)
  signal resume: () -> set_paused(false)
  query status: () -> current_status()
} = {
  stage loop = from source | process_batch()
}
```

### Saga Pattern for Compensation

```wv
-- Future: Transaction-like semantics
flow BookingFlow = {
  stage book_flight with {
    compensate: cancel_flight  -- runs on rollback
  } = from request | reserve_flight()

  stage book_hotel with {
    compensate: cancel_hotel
  } = from book_flight | reserve_hotel()
}
```

### Workflow Versioning

```wv
-- Future: Versioned flow definitions
flow OrderProcess with {
  version: 2
} = {
  stage validate = from order | validate_inventory()
  stage process = from validate | process_order()
}

-- Invoke specific version
stage order = call OrderProcess(version: 1)
```

### Dynamic Task Mapping

```wv
-- Future: Fan-out over dynamic inputs
flow BatchProcess = {
  stage list_files = from bucket | list_objects()

  stage process_each with {
    map: list_files.files  -- creates N parallel stages
  } = from _ | process_file()
}
```

- `trigger` property with rules
- `on_failure` conditional dependencies

### Phase 3: Flow-Level Configuration
- `schedule` and `timezone`
- `concurrency` limits
- Flow-level `timeout`

### Phase 4: Child Flow Invocation
- `call` keyword for child flows
- `parent_close` policy
- Child flow parameter passing

## Design Principles

1. **Backward compatible** - existing flows work unchanged
2. **SQL-inspired** - familiar syntax for data engineers
3. **Explicit over implicit** - clear dependency and execution semantics
4. **Declarative** - configuration over imperative code
5. **Type-safe** - duration literals and enums prevent errors
6. **Unambiguous grammar** - single syntax form, clear precedence

---

## Open Questions

1. Should `heartbeat` trigger automatic stage restart or just monitoring?
2. How should `schedule` interact with manual flow triggers?
3. Should child flows inherit parent's retry configuration by default?
4. How to handle circular dependencies in `on_failure` chains?
