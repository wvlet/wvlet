/**
  * Name represents a single leaf string value of term names (e.g., function name, variable, package
  * name) or type names (int, string, or user-defined types).
  *
  * Name is used for lookup entries in the symbol table (Scope) and Name needs to be created with
  * [[Name.termName]] or [[Name.typeName]] to ensure uniqueness of the name.
  *
  * The meaning of Name can be different depending on the current Scope. To resolve the meaning of
  * Name, its corresponding Symbol needs to be looked up in the current Scope, and resolve its
  * SymbolInfo.
  *
  *   - [[Name]] (string)
  *   - Search the current [[Scope]] (= SymbolTable) for the corresponding [[Symbol]]
  *   - From the [[Symbol]], check its [[SymbolInfo]] ([[DataType]], TypeDef, etc.), which will be
  *     refined as compiler phases proceed.
