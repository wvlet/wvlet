# Language Bindings

Wvlet provides SDKs for various programming languages, allowing you to compile Wvlet queries to SQL directly from your preferred language environment.

## Available SDKs

### [Python SDK](python.md) 
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/wvlet.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/wvlet/)

The Python SDK is now available with native performance and easy installation via pip:

```bash
pip install wvlet
```

```python
from wvlet import compile

sql = compile("from users select name, age where age > 18")
print(sql)  # SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 18
```

**Features:**
- Native library for high-performance compilation
- Automatic CLI fallback
- Support for all Wvlet features
- Integration with pandas, DuckDB, SQLAlchemy

## Planned SDKs

The following language bindings are planned for future releases:

- **Java/Scala** - Native JVM integration
- **Ruby** - Ruby gem with native extensions
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - npm package with WebAssembly support
- **Rust** - Cargo crate with native bindings
- **Go** - Go module with CGO bindings
- **C/C++** - Header-only library

## Native Library

All language SDKs use the same underlying native library (`libwvlet`) for consistent behavior and performance across languages. The native library is built using Scala Native and provides a C-compatible API.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to add more language bindings! If you're interested in creating an SDK for your favorite language:

1. Check the [Python SDK implementation](https://github.com/wvlet/wvlet/tree/main/sdks/python) as a reference
2. Use the native library API defined in [WvcLib.scala](https://github.com/wvlet/wvlet/blob/main/wvc/src/main/scala/wvlet/lang/native/WvcLib.scala)
3. Follow the language's best practices for packaging and distribution
4. Submit a pull request with your implementation
