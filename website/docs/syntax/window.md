# Window Function

Window function computes the data against the whole query result.

- partition by (key): Split the query resut into multiple partitions based on the key.
- order by (key): Define ordering of the rows within each partition.
- rows [start:end]: Define the range of rows in each window.

This query calculates the total amount of orders for each customer:
```sql
from orders
select sum(amount) over (partition by customer_id order by order_date)
```

## Window Frame 

In Wvlet, you can specify range of rows in each window with the following syntax:

| Syntax | Window Frame in SQL |
| --- | --- |
| rows [:0] | rows between unbounded preceding and current row (default) |
| rows [-1:1] | rows between 1 preceding and 1 following |
| rows [-1:0] | rows between 1 preceding and current row |
| rows [0:1] | rows between current row and 1 following |
| rows [0:] | rows between current row and unbounded following |


`rows [:0]` is the default window frame if no frame is specified. This means the window frame includes all rows from the first row of the partition to the current row.
