# Building Wvlet


## Building from Source 

To build Wvlet, you will need at least JDK17 or later. To test Trino connector, JDK23 or later is required (as of November 2024).  

```bash
# Clone the source code repository
git clone git@github.com:wvlet/wvlet.git
cd wvlet
./sbt
## This will install wv command to your ~/local/bin
sbt:wvlet> cli/packInstall
```

You can find the wvlet command in `~/local/bin/wv`. For convenience, you can set `PATH` environment variable like this:
```bash title='~/.bashenv'
export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
```

:::info
Mac users can install wvlet with Homebrew: [`brew install wvlet/wvlet/wvlet`](../usage/install.md)
:::


## Building Documentation 

Wvlet Documentation https://wvlet.org/wvlet is built with Docusaurus and GitHub Pages. To edit the documentation, you can start a local server to preview the documentation changes: 

```bash
cd website
```

Then start a documentation server at localhost:3000:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will be reloaded automatically when you update .md files.


`website/docs/` directory contains the markdown files for the documentation. Once your change is merged to the main branch, GitHub Action will update the public website automatically.


## Building Native Libraries


Wvlet can be compiled to a native library using Scala Native, which compiles Scala code to a native binary for the target OS and CPU architecture.

:::info
To build native libraries, you need to install `clang` and `llvm`, and `libstdc++-12-dev` on your system. See also [Scala Native Setup](https://scala-native.org/en/latest/user/setup.html). 
:::

To build libwvlet.so (Linux) or libwvlet.dylib (macOS), run the following command:

```bash
$ ./sbt
sbt:wvlet> wvcLib/nativeLink 
```

The library files will be generated in `wvc-lib/target/scala-3.3.4/` directory.

You can use methods defined in this library from C, C++, Rust, etc. 

Test the Rust binding:
```
$ cd wvc-lib
$ make rust
```

:::warning
Dynamic link library libwvlet is still experimental due to miscellaneous issues (e.g., segmentation fault). 
:::

```
$ make rust ARGS='-q "select 1"'
```

## Building Native Compiler (wvc)

Standalone compiler (wvc) can be built with Scala Native.


```bash
$ ./sbt
sbt:wvlet> wvc/nativeLink
```

```bash
$ ./wvc/target/scala-3.3.4/wvc -q "select 1"
-- wvlet version=2024.9.12, src=01JD5Q1CSBH59S686VS2RGWZE3.wv:1
select 1
```
